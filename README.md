# Philosophy

Philosophy is the matter of modeling thoughts using language to best conform to percieved reality or a constrained problem. When thinking about existensial questions of life, one need to deal with questions of the ultimate nature of reality and our own relationship to this percieved reality. Questions of human nature, sexuality, normality, power, spirituality, life, death and beyond are parts of this equation.

## The Short Version
Reality can be viewed as a recursive mind. A mind able to design and create worlds and inhabit those worlds with lesser minds of varying types. This oneness of mind that multiplies itself into being is what is called GOD. The nature of GOD cannot be expressed using language. GOD is beyond all conceptualization. 

Human beings are one aspect of GOD. We have bodies that interact with the world around us. The word body is used to denote the human body with arms, legs, a head, etc. Body could also signify the universe itself. The universe is the body of a higher being with a completely different mental size and model of its reality. 

When a human child is born, there is nothing inherently obvious about what constitutes the human body, and what constitues the environment. The child eventually discoveres that it has a body separate from the environment. The discovery is based on the separation of senses from the body and environment. Eventually one draws the logical conclusion that something is "mine" and other things are something else. In another type of existence, the body could be everything. A body so complex all mental effort goes into understanding and controlling it.

Aside from a recursive mind, perceptions can be viewed as recursive intermingling patterns. A multidimensional pattern that consitutes our perceptions and senses. The mind travels through the pattern with partial freedom on how the pattern develops. Some aspect of being is free will and some of it are the boundaries created by the higher mind. The higher and lesser minds coexist and harmonize to tell a story.

The highest mind, GOD, has free will without boundaries or rules. An infinitude of stories arising from patterns that result in different experiences, all of it in the mind of GOD.

In this universe, the principles of Good and Evil, life and death, are the central tenets of existence. It is what drives the civilisational narrative for all creatures in the universe. 

Good can be defined as one that is aware and evil is unawareness. Life is good, death is evil. Death is the shadow of life, without which, life could not be defined. The primarity duality of nature.

Unawareness is evil because the unaware body is dead. the unaware are creatues whos soul have left the body due to unfortunate circumstances. Violence. They are senseless pattern repeating machines. They have no intention. Only the living have intention. In modern language, another word for the dead are class I psychopathy. These types of bodies "live" only for self preservation and material obsessions. 

Children are born in Love. Children are free from concepts that have been normalized into the adult mind. Children explore life in awe of its beauty. Adults constrain children to whatever mental frame society has to offer. This mental frame becomes a prison of mind. Adults may regard children as unsavory due to their unawareness of human norms. This difference in mental perception of the world puts the child at odds with the parents. The parents humiliate the child, by force of habit, into a controlled mental frame. There is nothing good about this forced mental frame. It is what it is due to circumstances. If children were left to their own deviced to learn and adapt with maximum independence and freedom, a completely different kind of morality would arise as the child grows up.

On the other hand, if this mental enprisonment did not exists, the civilizational narrative would be dull and deadly. There would be no point in existing. There would be no narrative potential. A world which no one could stand to inhabit. In this sense, a perfect world is not desirable. There would be nothing to perfect.

The changing moral frame is the result of violence and trauma. When a body is violated, trauma ensues. The trauma creates a rip in the space time perception of the child. The child looses his higher perception of reality and falls into the limited domain of the parents. From here society continues to have a demoralizing effect on the child. The child looses his sense of oneness with GOD and adheres to idolatry and temptation.

The ultimate endevour of life is to rid oneself of the idolatry and temptations to come into onesness once again. To come into the state of mind of the child. Pure. Untouched. The Virgin Birth. 

This is the fundamental story about the spiritual awakening, The Rebirth, that all spiritual teachings share. The road to oneness, mental freedom, is different for everyone, but some of the tools to gain insight into what needs to take place are common to all. One such thing is isolation and rehabilitation. Inevitably one needs to unhabituate oneself from the idolotrous nature of human civilisation. This process can take a long time depending on the subjects psychology and willingness to undergo metamorphosis. The end result is freedom from bondage and a life in servitude to GOD. In this universe there is much to do and experience. There are many stories to be told. Civilizations rise and fall. Technologies come and go.

Once this existence is completed, a higher realm awaits with fundamentally different priciples and drives. A world where the universe and other worlds are functional parts of the higher realm.

## Language
Language is a set of symbols that connects perceptions to the domain of formal modeling. Language models our percieved reality. The type of language used decide how well a problem can be modeled.

## Idolatry
Idolatry is the idea of placing guiding importance into material relationships. It is the act of trusting and putting our faith and hope into someone or some thing or some group, whether that is family or religioun. Idolatry is hard to uncover. It rests in the shadow. Even when one believes he does not idolize, idolatry is hidden in plain sight. The idolatrer is unaware of his idolatry.

The main forms of idolatry are belief in parents, family and celebrities. Belief in organizations, the state, the church, universities, media etc.

Parent idolization is common. The notion that one should listen to the advice, wants and needs of parents by placing any special regard to that relationship on the basis of genetic inheritance. This type of idolatry is incurred by the parents by mean of violence and shaming. Relationships are best valued on the basis of mutual love, respect, and understanding. Sane parents are careful to advice their children and make sure their children grow up to meet their own destiny. That is the best way to form a healthy bond to children. It is a mistake to believe that bodily age brings forth wisdom. Children are often more wise than their parents. 

Religious idolatry is equally common. This is the notion that ones religious group and writings somehow play a central role in spiritual life. Religious groups have their own morals and traditions that have little to with spirituality and much to do with cults. They practice cultural worship but are blind to the fact of it being idolatrous. This goes for Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddists and others. Spiritual life is about forming an internal relationship with one self and GOD. No books or institutions are required.

Much of our idolatrous attitudes stem from the fear of trust in our own instincts.

## Sexuality
Sexuality stands at the root of the driving force of all living creates in the world. Sexuality is defines as the emotional and bodily pleasures that arise out of the process of reproduction. It is necesary for reproduction to be pleasurable in order for species to survive. 

A functional and enjoyable sex life is crucial to animals and humans alike. It plays a central role in all behaviour. Much of what we do is in pursuit of offspring wheter we are aware of it or not. Work titles are a means to display mating status. Material wealth and skill aquisition alike. 

Humans become aware of their sexuality from an early age, before sexual maturity. Everyone longs for intimacy and seeks pleasure. We can pleasure ourselfes but being pleasures by others is often more erotic.

All mammals seek erotic pleasure from and early age from their parents, tribe and peers. Giving and receiving pleasure is fundamental to emotional well being. For reasons of inbreeding it is in general important for children to leave their parents to find suitable mates. It is important that parents facilitate this, since children are unaware of the consequences of inbreeding. 

## Genital mutilation
In degenerate cultures, genital mutilation of males in particular becomes norm. This is an effort to control male sexuality. It puts the males to shame and their bodily rights are violated by cultural means. The practice has a huge negative impact on male well being.  

## Power
People who lack self control tend to impose control over others. It is the irony of power dynamics. Those who lack power of their desires, desire power over others. 

True power is about self realization and self control. The ability to control ones emotions and interactions with others without crossing boundaries. People who have this control do not seek to control others. Their power eminate from their ability to form strong relationships.

On the other hand, those who lack power and self control, desire power over others. 

## Psychopathy
Psychopathy is here defined as a person who has suffered traumatic violence. Psychopathy is matter of degree.

When the body is subject to horrific violence, the soul leaves the body. During this time, the soul does not see or feel any of the sensations that are taking place. After the situation is over, the soul returns to the body, unaware of what just transpired. The pattern of violence is stored in the brain, and the pattern is echoed in the body until the soul understands what transpired. 

The level of psychopaty is in proportion to the type of violence an individual is subject to. If enough violence is used, the soul may leave the body indefinetly. This leaves a soulless body that can be arbitrarily controlled. The body without a soul is here called a Class I psychopathy. The partially detchated soul is called Class II psychopathy.

### Class I
Class I psychopathy is defined as a body without a soul. A machine without purpose or intention that repeats whatever pattern that has been learned. There is no free will. Only pattern repetition. These bodies are completely unawarene.

### Class II
Class II psychopathy is a body with a partially detached soul. The soul is present but lacks full bodily control. The mind is damaged to some degree and the body is taken by temptations of varying kind depending on the types of experienced trauma.
