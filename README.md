# Philosophy

Philosophy is the matter of modeling thoughts using language to best conform to percieved reality or a constrained problem. When thinking about existensial questions of life, one need to deal with questions of the ultimate nature of reality and our own relationship to this percieved reality. Questions of human nature, sexuality, normality, power, spirituality, life, death and beyond are parts of this equation.

## The Short Version
Reality can be viewed as a recursive mind. A mind able to design and create worlds and inhabit those worlds with lesser minds of varying types. This oneness of mind that multiplies itself into being is what is called GOD. The nature of GOD cannot be expressed using language. GOD is beyond all conceptualization. 

Humam beings are one aspect of GOD. We have bodies that interact with the world around us. The word body is used to denote the human body with arms, legs, a head, etc. Body could also signify the universe itself. The universe is the body of a higher being with a complete different mental size and model of its reality. 

When a human child is born, there is nothing inherently obvious about what constitutes the human body, and what constitues the environment. The child eventually discoveres that it has a body separate from the environment. The discovery is based on the separation of senses from the body and environment. Eventually one draws the logical conclusion that something is "mine" and other things are something else. In another type of existence, the body could be everything. A body so complex all mental effort goes into controlling it.

Aside from a recursive mind, perceptions can be viewed as recursive intermingling patterns. A multidimensional pettern that consitutes our perceptions and different senses. The mind travels through the pattern with partial freedom on how the pattern develops. Some aspect of being is free will and some of it are the boundaries created by the higher mind. The higher and lesser minds coexist and harmonize to tell a story.

The highest mind, GOD, has free will without boundaries or rules. An infinitude of stories arising from patterns that result in different experiences, all of it in the mind of GOD. In this sense, everything is intelligent.

In the human universe reality, the principles of Good and Evil, life and death, are the central tenets of existence. It is what drives the civilisational narrative for all creates in the universe. 

Good can be defined as one that is selfless, loving, caring, helpful and one who does not tresspass on others boundaries. One can have these qualities because the good one is aware. The evil one is the opposite. Selfish, hateful, unaware and therefore void of boundaries. Life is good, death is evil. Death is the shadow of life, without which life could not be defined. The primarity duality of nature. 

Children are born in Love. Children are free from concepts that have been normalized into the adult mind. Children explore life in awe of its beauty. Adults contrain children to whatever mental frame society has to offer. This mental frame becomes a prison of mind. Adults may regard children as unsavory due to their unawareness of human norms. This difference in mental perception of the world puts the child at odds with the parents. The parents humiliate the child, by force of habit, into a controlled mental frame. There is nothing good about this forced mental frame. It is what it is due to circumstances. If children were left to their own deviced to learn and adapt with maximum independence and freedom, a completely different kind of morality would arise as the child grows up. 

The changing moral frame is the result of violence and trauma. When a body is violated, trauma ensues. The trauma creates a rip in the space time perception of the child. The child looses his higher perception of reality and falls into the limited domain of the parents. From here society continues to have a demoralizing effect on the child. The child looses his sense of oneness with GOD and adheres to idolatry and temptation.

The ultimate endevour of life is to rid oneself of the idolatry and temptations to come into onesness once again. To come into the state of mind of the child. Pure. Untouched. The Virgin birth. 

This is the fundamental story about the spiritual awakening, The Rebirth, that all spiritual teachings share. The road to oneness, mental freedom, is different for everyone, but some of the tools to gain insight into what needs to take place are common to all. One such thing is isolation and rehabilitation. Inevitably one needs to unhabituate oneself from the idolotrous nature of human civilisation. This process can take a long time depending on the subjects psychology and willingness to undergo metamorphosis. The end result is freedom from bondage and a life in servitude to GOD. 

## Language
It is important to understand that language is a set of symbols that connects perception to a mental domain of model. Language models our percieved reality. The type of language used decide how well a problem can be modeled.
